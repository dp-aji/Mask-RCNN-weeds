# Mask RCNN instance segmentation for weeds detection
Deep learning already has the capability to study images that can be used in object detection with instance segmentation. To develop human performance in overcoming weeds detection with deep learning.
instance segmentation can be useful for this project, because weeds can growth with different size and shape, in that case instance segmentation is the proper detection on this project.
Then after MASK RCNN can detect the weeds with shape and location of the weeds, a feature was added to determine the center of the detection or centroid. which can be developed as a herbicide spraying point or can be used for other developments. this centroid point is a very useful feature in this weeds case.

# Image Acquisition
A.	Image acquisition
Images or photos used as training data obtained from several corn crop plantations in Curup, Bengkulu. picture taken by using a mobile phone camera, the picture of corn plants that have weeds around the corn, and the age of corn plants is about 1-2 weeks, when the of corn still small look like the weeds. The appearance of corn plants similar like weed plants. Here are some examples of photos for dataset taken that with differentiating factors.

The image is taken from above, to get the position of the image that corresponds to the machine later. Images of corn plants taken about 1000 pictures / photos with different factors. The photo taken has JPG format. With image sizes of 4000x3000, 4608x2128, and 4160x3120. For the machine to be implemented it will look like this.
